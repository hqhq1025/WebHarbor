# Search URL Realism

## Policy

Search forms should emit the URL shape used by the real upstream site whenever
that shape is known. Legacy `/search?q=...` routes remain as compatibility
aliases for existing benchmark tasks, hand-written trajectories, and old links.

This keeps the user-visible behavior realistic without breaking existing local
WebHarbor consumers.

## Canonical Search URLs

| Site | Canonical URL | Legacy alias |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Amazon | `/s?k=<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Booking | `/searchresults.html?ss=<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Google Maps | `/maps/search/<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| ESPN | `/search/_/q/<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Apple | `/search/<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Coursera | `/search?query=<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Hugging Face | `/search/full-text?q=<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Cambridge Dictionary | `/search/direct/?datasetsearch=english&q=<query>` | `/search?q=<query>` |
| Cambridge Thesaurus | `/search/english-thesaurus/direct/?datasetsearch=english-thesaurus&q=<query>` | `/thesaurus?q=<query>` |

## Canonical Non-search Entry Aliases

Some upstream sites expose task-critical pages under common paths that are not
pure search forms. These aliases should resolve in the mirror so browser agents
can use realistic URLs and so generated tasks do not need mirror-only path
knowledge.

| Site | Realistic URL | Mirror target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Booking | `/searchresults?ss=<query>` | same handler as `/searchresults.html?ss=<query>` |
| Apple | `/shop/bag` | `/bag` |
| Coursera | `/specializations/<slug>` | `/learn/<slug>` |
| BBC News | `/news` | `/` |
| WolframAlpha | `/?i=<query>` | `/input?i=<query>` |

The root cause for these aliases is mismatch between real upstream public URLs
and earlier mirror-only route names. The fix belongs in the Flask route layer,
not in task generators; generators should be allowed to use realistic URLs.

Some sites already matched their upstream search shape closely and are
documented rather than changed here:

- Google Search: `/search?q=<query>` plus vertical parameters such as `tbm=...`.
- GitHub: `/search?q=<query>&type=...`.
- BBC: `/search?q=<query>`.
- arXiv: `/search/?query=<query>&searchtype=...`.
- WolframAlpha: `/input?i=<query>` for computation and `/search?q=...` for
  topic search.
- Google Flights: primary flight searches already use `/flights?...`; the
  generic `/search?q=...` page is a local airport/city/airline helper.

HTML forms can only submit query-string values, so path-based canonical search
URLs use a small submit handler that rewrites the destination before navigation.
If JavaScript is unavailable, the route still accepts the form-submitted query
string at the same canonical prefix where possible, and the old alias remains
available.

## Regression Check

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_search_url_realism.py
```

The check verifies that the UI emits canonical search URLs and that the legacy
aliases remain wired to the same route handlers.
