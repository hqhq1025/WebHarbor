"""Supervisor wrapper for one Flask site.

Why this exists: Werkzeug's threaded serve_forever() doesn't honor SIGTERM
(installs / shadows handlers, blocks in C-level select). We can't kill Flask
cleanly via SIGTERM. So we run Flask as a child subprocess of this thin
supervisor, and the supervisor itself is the PID that control_server tracks.
SIGTERM to the supervisor → supervisor SIGKILLs the child → exits.
The supervisor's main loop is os.waitpid() which IS interruptible by signals.

Usage: python3 /opt/site_runner.py <site_name> <port>
